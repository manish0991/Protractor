#  The following Scenarios cover actually setting new password after reset email received
#  (covered in a separate script)
  Feature:Create New Password
#  
#  Background:
#      Creating a new password completes the login process and user is taken
#      to landing page / dashboard
#      
#      Given I've clicked the email link to reset password
#      And I've landed on the 'Create Password' page
 
  Background:
	 Given I am on the Venzee web site
	 Then I go to reset password screen

   @NA      
  Scenario: Create new password successfully
	And I apply for new password
	And I redirect to check my email
	And I open the given Link
    When I enter a new password that is between 10 and 255 characters
    And The new password contains at least 2 upper letters
    And The new password includes at least 2 digits
    And the confirmed password matches the new password
    Then I should be logged in and directed to the <LandingPage> appropriate for my <Role>
  
#    Examples:
#    |Role|LandingPage|
#    |Companies send me spreadsheets|Products|
#    |I use spreadsheets to update the companies I do business with|Products|
#    |Systems critical to my business arenâ€™t connected|Integration|
